         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONY AGAINST Gaming, Muſick, Dancing, Singing, Swearing, AND <hi>People calling upon God to Damn them:</hi> Commended to the Conſciences of all People in the ſight of God, But more eſpecially to thoſe who keep Publick-Houſes.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> SEE that you ſuffer none to play at any ſort of Game in your houſes, <hi>viz. <hi>Cards, Dice, Tables, Shuffle-board,</hi>
               </hi> and the like, for in ſo doing you will diſpleaſe the Lord, and may cauſe him to bring a Blaſt upon all your undertakings: But on the contrary, reprove and admoniſh ſuch in Gods fear; for it never was the Practice of Gods People in the primitive times to game away their precious time which the Lord gave them to <hi>work out their own Salvation in</hi>; neither is it the Practice of them that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed in this day, though the <hi>Nominal Chriſtians</hi> may plead for it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, you that know the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>true Chriſtianity,</hi> bear your teſtimonies againſt <hi>Gaming</hi> faithfully, for it is as it were a piece of <hi>Witchcraft</hi>; for when mens hearts and minds are exerciſed in it, they are even overcome by the ſame, and ſo are ſerving the Enemy of their own immortal Souls with all their ſtrength, and the fear of the Lord is not before their Eyes; for when their hearts and minds are exerciſed in their <hi>Games,</hi> it is as it were their <hi>Godd,</hi> and often times tends to <hi>Quarrelling, Fighting</hi> and <hi>Bloodſhed.</hi> It is therefore good for all that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in deed and in truth, to bear your Teſtimonies againſt <hi>Gaming</hi>; for this is certainly true, that the Lord and his Truth is diſhonoured by admitting People to game in your Houſes: Therefore be careful in bringing <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by bearing your Teſtimonies for him and his Truth, againſt that that is diſpleaſing unto the Lord, and hurtful unto your own poor Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> See that you ſuffer none to play upon any ſort of <hi>Muſick,</hi> nor any to <hi>Dance, Sing</hi> or <hi>Swear</hi> in your houſes; but bear your Teſtimonies againſt ſuch things, both by reproving them in Gods fear and love, and in obſtructing the ſame; for they are all diſpleaſing in the ſight of the Lord, and may cauſe his Judgments to come upon your Houſes and Families. Therfore to prevent the ſame from coming upon you, live up to that Gift which the Lord hath given you, that you may ſtand in your paces and bear a Teſtimony for the Lord and his Truth in your Day, Age and Generation; then will the Lord bleſs and proſper you, both inwardly and outwardly, and in all that you undertake; and all that do rejoyce, <hi>let them Rejoyce in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſick</hi> is a thing that ſtealeth the hearts of them that play upon it, or adhere unto it, from the Lord (and tends to raiſe up a <hi>light, airy, frothy, wanton Mind;</hi> for they that <hi>live in Pleaſures, are dead while they live;</hi> and they that <hi>live wantonly, kill the juſt</hi>;) for when mens hearts and minds are exerciſed by it, they remember not the Lord, that made them and all Mankind <hi>for a purpoſe of his own Glory</hi>; but ſpend away their precious time in that which the Lord by his Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> bore Teſtimony againſt, as you may read in th 6th Chapter of the Prophecy of that Prophet, in which he pronounceth a <hi>Wo <hi>unto them that chaunt unto the</hi> Viol, <hi>and invent unto themſelves</hi> Inſtruments of Muſick, <hi>like unto</hi>
               </hi> David. Do ſuch <hi>Remember their Creator in the dayes of their Youth?</hi> No; they have rather forgotten their Maker, which would be their <hi>Saviour,</hi> if they would come to be ſaved by him, from their <hi>periſhing fading Vanities,</hi> which God and his People are againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Dancing</hi> are of the ſame Root and Ground with <hi>Gaming</hi> and <hi>Muſick,</hi> &amp;c. all which proceed from that ſeed which the Enemy of Man and Womans Salvation hath ſown in the hearts of the <hi>Children of Diſobedience,</hi> which enemy is the <hi>Devil,</hi> who <hi>walks about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> And ſuch who let loſe their hearts, minds and affections after thoſe things, perſuing and following with greedineſs after the ſame, are making an <hi>Idol</hi> of them, and do deſire more after them than they do after the knowledge of God, <hi>whom to know is Life Eternal</hi>; and ſo hereby God, who alone ought to be ſought after and bowed down unto, is robbed of that which is his right, even the <hi>Praiſe,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> and the <hi>Glory of his Name,</hi> which ought to be given unto him from every reaſonable Creature that he hath made by his mighty Power; for it is the incumbant duty of all Mankind to ſerve the Lord above all things, even with all their Souls and all their Might, and not run into <hi>fading Vanities,</hi> which periſh in the uſing, and which bring <hi>Tribulation, Anguiſh</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> upon all that are found in them; for <hi>God will not be mocked; ſuch as every man ſows, ſuch they muſt reap from divine Juſtice, who renders unto every man according unto his deeds, without reſpect of Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some that delight in Muſick may object, <hi>That</hi> David <hi>and others of the People of God, did play upon Inſtruments of <hi>Muſick.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer; David</hi> and others who were faithful to God, did not play upon <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſick</hi> to ſtir up, raiſe and elivate a <hi>vain, ſinful, unclean Mind</hi> in themſelves or any other; but their playing upon and uſe of <hi>Inſtruments of Muſick</hi> being under the Shadowy diſpenſation of the Law, what they did herein, they did it unto the Lord. The Prieſts under the Law had a command to <hi>ſound Trumpets,</hi> which was a ſort of <hi>Muſick</hi>; and <hi>David</hi> and others made uſe of other Inſtruments, as the <hi>Flute, Harp</hi> and <hi>Symbal</hi>; and this they did in honour and praiſe to the Lord, and not to ſtir up a <hi>vain, wanton, light, airy, fleſhly</hi> and <hi>ungodly Mind,</hi> as it may be ſeen in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
            <p>Again, ſome may plead for <hi>Dancing, <hi>becauſe</hi>
               </hi> David <hi>danced before the Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Dancing</hi> was in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> and was a token of his rejoycing, becauſe of the <hi>Ark of God,</hi> which was brought back out of the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> Land, who were Enemies to God and his People: This <hi>Dancing</hi> was not like the <hi>Dancing</hi> of the <hi>vain, wanton</hi> and <hi>prophane Perſons</hi> of our Age, nor yet like the <hi>Dancing</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi>'s Daughter, who danced before King <hi>Herod,</hi> who after ſhe had danced, demanded the Head of the Man of God, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and had it, being thereunto inſtructed by her malicious Mother.</p>
            <p>As concerning <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi>; true <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> the Lord God did own under the Law, which was Shadowy, and ſtood in many carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which were to continue <hi>until the time of Reformation,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. which time is the Time of the Goſpel, which is come.</p>
            <p>Again, God did and doth own <hi>Singing</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi> under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel; but the <hi>Singers</hi> that God doth own under the Goſpel diſpenſation, are thoſe who are firſt taught by him to Mourn for, Repent of &amp; forſake their Sins; ſuch who are led by the Spirit of the Lord to mourn for, repent of and forſake their Sins, in the ſame Spirit they may <hi>Sing,</hi> as it moves and leads them. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will <hi>Sing</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and with <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi>
               </hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. And it is written, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. <hi>The <hi>Redeemed</hi> of the Lord ſhall return to</hi> Sion <hi>with <hi>Songs</hi> of <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
               </hi> And it is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. <hi>They that were <hi>Redeemed</hi> from the Earth ſang the <hi>Song</hi> of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Lamb. And Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2, 3.) <hi>Sorrow <hi>is better than</hi> Laughter; <hi>and its better to go into the</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Mourning <hi>than into the</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Mirth: Mourning, <hi>in the unregenerate, in the ſence of their Sins, is better than</hi> Laughter <hi>and</hi> Singing. <hi>And God will turn the</hi> Songs <hi>of the Wicked into</hi> Mourning, <hi>Amos</hi>
               </hi> 8.10. And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. <hi>Every <hi>Idle Word</hi> that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an Account thereof in the day of Judgment.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who among you ſeem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this mans Religion is vain,</hi> James 1.26.</p>
            <p>Obſerve that <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> the Heathen King, and his company of Idolaters had <hi>Muſick</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Sound of the <hi>Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sacbut, Pſaltery</hi> and <hi>Dulſimer,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Muſick,</hi> when they worſhipped the Golden Image that he had ſet up: Theſe were they which caſt the three Children into the fiery Furnace. This their <hi>Muſick</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> was Wicked and Ungodly.</p>
            <p>Again, obſerve, the Apoſtle ſaid unto the true <hi>Chriſtians, Be ye not drunk with <hi>Wine,</hi> wherein is Exceſs, but be filled with the Spirit; ſpeaking to your ſelves in <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> Singing and making Melody in your Hearts to the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 5.19.</p>
            <p>Alſo, <hi>Swearing</hi> and calling upon <hi>God to Damn them,</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> the pure, holy and undefiled <hi>Name of God,</hi> proceeds even from the ſame Root that <hi>Gaming, Muſick, Singing</hi> and <hi>Dancing</hi> do ariſe and ſpring from: Therefore let none who are found in any of theſe things, (to wit, in <hi>Swearing, Damning, Curſing</hi> and <hi>Blaſpheming the Name of the Lord</hi>) think to eſcape Gods Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments; for it is written, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his <hi>Name in Vain.</hi>
               </hi> And the Lord complains by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Swearing</hi> the Land <hi>Mourneth,</hi>
               </hi> Jer. 23.10.</p>
            <p>Therefore all you that are concerned, as Witneſſes for God ſee that you bear your Teſtimonies againſt theſe things, that the Lord may bleſs you and proſper you in all your Undertakings, that the <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> which is his due he may receive from you, and you from him a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> which fadeth not away when time here ſhall be no more.</p>
